Page structure & landmarks  \n  – Add a meaningful <title> in the <head> (e.g., “12 Bad UX Examples – Expert Analysis | Eleken”).  \n  – Ensure exactly one <h1> at the top of the article (e.g., the blog post title).  \n  – Include a “Skip to main content” link at the top for keyboard users.\n\n2. Headings hierarchy  \n  – Use <h1> for the page title, <h2> for major sections, <h3> for subsections, etc.  \n  – This helps screen readers and assists with logical navigation.\n\n3. Color & contrast (even if no text failed):  \n  – Verify all text-overlay and link-hover colors meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.  \n  – Run WebAIM or Lighthouse checks for each color combination.\n\n4. Alt text & non-text content  \n  – Although no images were flagged by the basic scan, manually confirm that every <img> (including decorative and content images) has an appropriate alt attribute:  \n      • Informational images need descriptive alt text.  \n      • Decorative images should have alt=\"\".\n\n5. Keyboard & focus  \n  – Add clear focus styles (outline or underline) on interactive elements (links, buttons).  \n  – Ensure all custom controls (e.g., TOC items, video overlays) are keyboard-accessible (use tabindex, ARIA where needed).\n\n6. ARIA and landmarks  \n  – Use landmark roles (header, nav, main, footer) or HTML5 semantic tags.  \n  – Ensure dynamic content (e.g., expanding FAQ accordions) updates ARIA-expanded on controls.\n\n7. Testing steps  \n  – Re-run automated scans (Lighthouse, axe-core).  \n  – Perform manual keyboard navigation and screen-reader testing (NVDA/VoiceOver).  \n  – Validate on mobile devices for touch-target size and orientation.\n\nNext steps  \n1. Prioritize the missing <title>, H1, and skip link—critical for navigation.  \n2. Refine headings and ensure semantic structure.  \n3.
