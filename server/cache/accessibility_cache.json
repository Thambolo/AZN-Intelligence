Missing “Skip to main content” link (WCAG 2.4.1) – keyboard and screen-reader users have no quick way to bypass repetitive navigation.  \n2. Heading structure anomaly (WCAG 2.4.6) – tool did not detect the single H1; verify exactly one H1 and a logical H2–H6 hierarchy.  \n3. Landmark roles not explicit (WCAG 1.3.1 / 2.4.1) – main, header, nav and footer elements should include ARIA roles or HTML5 landmarks to aid orientation.  \n4. Color-contrast sampling (WCAG 1.4.3) – navigation and interface text appears to meet contrast ratios, but spot-check all custom colors, buttons and focus outlines.  \n5. Focus indication (WCAG 2.4.7) – ensure all interactive elements have a visible, non-color focus indicator.\n\nAI-powered analysis & recommendations  \n1. “Skip to main” link – inject an off-screen anchor at top of the body (e.g. `<a href=\"#main\" class=\"skip-link\">Skip to main content</a>`) and style it to become visible on focus.  \n2. Headings – audit your HTML so that H1 is unique (the university name) and subsequent section titles use H2/H3. This ensures screen readers can navigate the page outline.  \n3. Landmarks – use HTML5 `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` or ARIA landmarks (`role=\"navigation\"`, `role=\"main\"`) to provide a page map to assistive tools.  \n4. Keyboard users – verify that carousels, dropdowns and pop-overs are reachable, operable with Tab/Enter/Escape, and that focus is trapped or returned appropriately.  \n5. Images & media – all decorative images should have empty `alt=\"\"`; informative images and icons must carry descriptive alt text, or use `aria-hidden=\"true\"` on purely decorative SVGs.  \n6. Dynamic content – ensure content that appears (e.g. “more” toggle, gallery tabs) is announced to screen readers via ARIA or appropriate DOM updates (e.g. `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`).  \n7. Color contrast – maintain at least 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI graphics. Include focus ring colors in contrast checks.  \n8. Form and link labeling – while this page has few inputs, make sure any forms in other views have `<label>` or `aria-label` associated with each control.\n\nNext steps  \n– Add a skip-link and landmark roles.  \n– Run a manual keyboard walkthrough of all menus, carousels and pop-overs.  \n– Conduct a screen-reader test (NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify reading order, toggle announcements and focus management.  \n– After the fixes, re-run the audit to confirm that the score has improved towards 100.",
